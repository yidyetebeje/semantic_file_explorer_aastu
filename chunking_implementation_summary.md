# Document Chunking Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds document chunking to the semantic file explorer. Instead of embedding entire documents as single vectors, we now split documents into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks before embedding. This approach has several advantages:

1. More precise search results by matching specific chunks rather than whole documents
2. Support for longer documents without information loss
3. Better handling of varying content within a single document

## Key Changes

### 1. Added Document Chunking

- Created a new `chunker.rs` module with `chunk_text` function using the `text-splitter` crate
- Configured optimal chunk size (500-1500 characters) for better semantic boundaries
- Added error handling and tests for the chunking functionality

### 2. Modified Embedding Process

- Updated `embedder.rs` to process chunks separately
- Modified the `embed_text` function to return multiple embeddings per document
- Added `get_chunk_count` helper function

### 3. Updated Database Schema

- Modified `db.rs` to include a `chunk_id` field in the database schema
- Updated `upsert_document` to handle multiple embeddings per document
- Modified query processing to handle multiple chunks per document

### 4. Updated Search Logic

- Modified `search.rs` to handle multiple chunks per document
- Implemented deduplication to return the highest scoring chunk per file
- Added tests for chunk-based search

### 5. Fixed File Type Support

- Enhanced `extractor.rs` to properly support txt and md files

## Benefits

1. **Improved Search Accuracy**: By matching specific chunks instead of entire documents, search results are more relevant and precise.

2. **Support for Larger Documents**: Documents that would previously exceed token limits can now be properly indexed and searched.

3. **Better Content Understanding**: The system now understands document structure better, with semantic boundaries preserving context.

## Testing

All tests have been updated to work with the new chunking system and are passing successfully.

## Future Enhancements

1. Consider adding metadata to store chunk position in document
2. Optimize chunk size based on token count rather than character count
3. Explore advanced chunking strategies for different file types
