# Chapter Five: System Implementation

## 5.1 Reviewing the Design Solution

In the design phase, we set out to enable fast, accurate semantic search and exploration of local text documents on the userâ€™s file system. The core architecture comprises a Rust-based backend powered by Tauri, responsible for:

- **File system monitoring** via `notify` crate (watcher.rs) to detect file creations, modifications, and deletions.
- **Content extraction** (extractor.rs) and **hashing** to identify changed documents.
- **Text chunking** (chunker.rs) for semantically meaningful segments.
- **Vector embeddings** (embedder.rs) using FastEmbed (BGE-Small-EN-v1.5) and caching for performance.
- **Vector store** management with LanceDB (db.rs) to index and query embeddings.
- **Semantic search** logic (search.rs) that ranks candidates by cosine similarity.

On the front end, a React + TypeScript UI (App.tsx, components/) uses:

- **Jotai** atoms (store/atoms.ts) for state management.
- **Tailwind CSS** + Radix UI for a responsive, modern interface.
- A thin **Tauri API** layer (services/commands.ts) to invoke Rust commands asynchronously.

Overall, the implementation closely aligns with our objectives: real-time indexing, accurate semantic retrieval, and an intuitive desktop UI. The modular separation between watcher, extractor, embedder, and search maintains clarity and ease of extension.

## 5.2 Deciding on the Development Tools

To balance performance, cross-platform compatibility, and developer productivity, the following toolchain was selected:

| Layer           | Language/Tool               | Purpose                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Backend         | Rust + Tauri                | System daemon, file I/O, performance     |
| Vector CLI      | FastEmbed (Rust crate)      | Text embedding with BGE-Small-EN-v1.5    |
| Vector store    | LanceDB                     | On-disk vector database with Arrow schema|
| File watcher    | notify crate                | Cross-platform FS event monitoring       |
| Frontend        | React + TypeScript + Vite   | Fast Hot Reloading UI                    |
| UI components   | Radix UI + Tailwind CSS     | Accessible, themeable components         |
| State Mgmt      | Jotai                       | Simple atomic state                     |
| Packaging       | Tauri CLI                   | Desktop app bundling                      |
| Version control | Git + PNPM                  | Dependency management, reproducible builds|

**Environment setup:**

1. Install Rust (stable) and Cargo.
2. Install Node.js (>=16) and pnpm.
3. Run `pnpm install` in the project root.
4. Run `cargo install tauri-cli` or use `pnpm tauri`.
5. Configure `tauri.conf.json`, `vite.config.ts`, and `tailwind.config.js` as per defaults.

## 5.3 Developing the Solution

### Coding Practices

- **Async/Await** in Rust (Tokio) and TypeScript for non-blocking I/O.
- **Error handling** with `thiserror` and detailed logs via `tracing` in Rust.
- **Unit tests** in both Rust (`#[cfg(test)]`) and TS (Jest) to validate core logic.
- **Modularization**: each concern (watcher, db, embedder, search) lives in its own module.

### Integration Strategy

- **Tauri commands** expose backend functions to the frontend (e.g., `semantic_search_command`, `index_folder_command`).
- **IPC** via `@tauri-apps/api` to invoke Rust commands from React.
- **State synchronization**: results stored in Jotai atoms and rendered in React components.

### Major Functionality Highlights

- **Watcher + DB combo** (`setup_watcher_with_db` in watcher.rs): initializes a LanceDB table and FS watcher in one call.

```rust
let (watcher, rx, table) = setup_watcher_with_db("/Users/you/Documents").await?;
process_events(rx, table).await;
```

- **Embedding pipeline** (`embed_text` in embedder.rs): chunks input text, generates embeddings, and returns `Vec<Vec<f32>>`.

- **Semantic search** (`semantic_search_command` in search_commands.rs): accepts a query string, queries LanceDB for nearest neighbors, and returns ranked document paths.

- **Front-end query flow** (`services/commands.ts`): wraps Tauri `invoke` calls and updates Jotai atoms for UI rendering.

### Challenges and Resolutions

- **Model download latency** mitigated by lazy initialization (`once_cell::Lazy`) and caching in `.cache/`.
- **File-system events noise** filtered by supported extensions and hidden files logic in `is_relevant_file`.
- **Schema evolution** handled by compatibility checks in `schemas_compatible`.

By following this structured implementation, the system meets our design goals and provides a robust, maintainable foundation for future features (e.g., PDF support, UI theming, batch indexing).
